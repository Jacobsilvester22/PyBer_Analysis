# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview ##
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary dataframe from the PyBer Ride data. Through this dataframe we look to compare how total fare of rides in three different city types: Rural, Suburban and Urban, differ between the begining of January to the end of April in 2019.
## Results ##
### PyBer Dataframe ###
Overall there are three main results from our PyBer dataframe. We see that in urban cities there is a much larger frequency of rides taken and subsequently more drivers in those cities. Suburban has the second most and rural has the least. We also see that in urban cities there is an average ride fare of $24.53, rural cities are on average ten dollars more at $34.62. The average fare per driver in rural cities is $55.49 whereas in urban cities there is an average of $16.57.<br>

### Total Fare by City Type ###
Compiling the information seen in the PyBer dataframe we can evaluate the total week fare per city type. Overall we see that urban total fares are well above suburban and rural fares. Where urban fares are about 7 times higher on average than rural fares.<br>

## Summary ##
In the end there is clearly more drivers and rides taken in urban cities. One of the main results to focus on would be the fact that the average fare for rural driver is much higher than in urban drivers. This is most likely due to the reult of the rural drivers have trips for much higher distances. This in turn could have a negative impact in these areas and would be specifically where I would focus future business. It will be important to have drivers more readily avalible in this areas as drivers will be detained for longer periods of time. Now although the demand for rides will not be as high in these areas, there may be ways to increase demand. For example, there are often surge charges in urban cities that will sky rocket the prices. If there was a way to lower the prices to increase demand but not lower enough to drive away workers, rural areas would allow for greater success.
